The core of the auditor-action. This is the package that does the heavy lifting. It is not meant to be used directly, but rather as a dependency of the auditor-action

## About üí°

This package is the core of the auditor-action. It works by doing the following:

1. Loads the `auditor.yml` configuration file
2. Loads the Git Diff in JSON format from the [git-diff-action](https://github.com/GrantBirki/git-diff-action)
3. Uses the config file to process the JSON git diff and looks for violations
4. Reports the violations as a comment on the PR depending on what environment variables are set
